# R Projects Repository

## Overview

This repository contains two R projects that demonstrate different aspects of data analysis, manipulation, and visualization in R. These projects explore different datasets and techniques, providing insights into association rule mining and exploratory data analysis.

## Contents

### 1. **[Apriori Algorithm on Groceries Dataset](./apriori-groceries/)**  
   This project implements the **Apriori algorithm** to mine frequent itemsets and discover association rules from the Groceries dataset. The goal is to identify relationships between items frequently purchased together.  
   - **Key Features**: Data preprocessing, frequent itemset mining, association rules, rule visualization.
   - **Tech Stack**: `arules`, `arulesViz`.

### 2. **[Diamonds Data Analysis](./diamonds-data-analysis/)**  
   This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the `diamonds` dataset, using Râ€™s data manipulation, visualization, and statistical functions. The analysis includes data cleaning, summary statistics, and visualizations like bar plots, scatter plots, and histograms.  
   - **Key Features**: Data cleaning, summary statistics, visualization (bar plots, scatter plots, histograms).
   - **Tech Stack**: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyverse`, `janitor`.

## Prerequisites

To run these projects, ensure that you have the following installed:

1. **R**: Version 3.6 or higher.
2. **RStudio**: Optional, but recommended for an IDE.
3. **Required Packages**:
   - `arules`
   - `arulesViz`
   - `tidyverse`
   - `ggplot2`
   - `dplyr`
   - `janitor`

You can install all required packages using:

```r
install.packages(c("arules", "arulesViz", "tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "janitor"))
```

## Project Details

### 1. **Apriori Algorithm on Groceries Dataset**
   - **Dataset**: `Groceries` from the `arules` package.
   - **Objective**: To find frequent itemsets and association rules.
   - **Visualizations**: Graphical representations of association rules.
   - **Files**:
     - `apriori_groceries.R`: R script implementing the Apriori algorithm and visualizing the rules.

### 2. **Diamonds Data Analysis**
   - **Dataset**: `diamonds` from the `ggplot2` package.
   - **Objective**: To perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize relationships between different diamond characteristics.
   - **Visualizations**: Bar plots (total carat per cut), scatter plots (price vs. carat), and histograms (price distribution).
   - **Files**:
     - `diamonds_analysis.R`: R script for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization of the `diamonds` dataset.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/r-projects.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to a project folder**:

   ```bash
   cd r-projects/<project-folder-name>
   ```

3. **Open the R Project**:
   Open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio or run the R script (`.R`) files in the console.
